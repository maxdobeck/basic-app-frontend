# Scheduler-Frontend

> Frontend Vue.js app.

## Build Setup
use `yarn or npm`

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3030
yarn start

# build for production with minification
yarn build
```

## Background
This app was built in parallel with https://github.com/maxdobeck/gatekeeper.  This is essentially a Single Page Application that makes API calls with the Fetch command to get the data needed.

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
